# Learn React

Hi there! I am going to [learn React](https://learn-react-abhi6722.vercel.app/docs/intro) starting from today and I am going to update this documentation regularly and share everything along my learning journey. This will not just some theoritical guide rather it will be more like a project based guide in which I will Learn by doing. Let's start this journey on a high note. This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. 

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
