# Tutorial Intro

Hi there! 
I am going to learn **React** starting from today and I am going to update this documentation regularly and share everything along my learning journey. This will not just some theoritical guide rather it will be more like a project based guide in which I will **Learn by doing**.
Let's start this journey on a high note.

## Getting Started

**ReactJS** is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library which is responsible only for the view layer of the application. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.


## Why we use ReactJS?

The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which improves the performance of the app. The JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM. We can use ReactJS on the client and server-side as well as with other frameworks. It uses component and data patterns that improve readability and helps to maintain larger apps.


## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.



Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.
