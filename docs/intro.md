# Tutorial Intro

Hi there! 
I am going to learn **React** starting from today and I am going to update this documentation regularly and share everything along my learning journey. This will not just some theoritical guide rather it will be more like a project based guide in which I will **Learn by doing**.
Let's start this journey on a high note.

## What is React?
- React is a JavaScript library - one of the most popular ones, with over 100,000 stars on GitHub.
- React is not a framework (unlike Angular, which is more opinionated).
- React is an open-source project created by Facebook.
- React is used to build user interfaces (UI) on the front end.
- React is the view layer of an MVC application (Model View Controller)

One of the most important aspects of React is the fact that you can create components, which are like custom, reusable HTML elements, to quickly and efficiently build user interfaces. React also streamlines how data is stored and handled, using state and props.

## What is ReactJS?
**ReactJS** is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library which is responsible only for the view layer of the application. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.

## Why we use ReactJS?
The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which improves the performance of the app. The JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM. We can use ReactJS on the client and server-side as well as with other frameworks. It uses component and data patterns that improve readability and helps to maintain larger apps.

## Prerequisites
There are a few things you should know in advance before you start playing around with React. If you've never used JavaScript or the DOM at all before, for example, I would get more familiar with those before trying to tackle React.

Here are what I consider to be React prerequisites.

- Basic familiarity with HTML & CSS.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and programming.
- Basic understanding of the DOM.
- Familiarity with ES6 syntax and features.
- Node.js and npm installed globally.
