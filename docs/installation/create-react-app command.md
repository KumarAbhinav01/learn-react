# Create React App

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have `Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6` on your machine. To create a project, run:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

After running this command it will start downloading the essential packages. Now use **cd** command to go inside folder.

```
cd my-app
```

Now use **npm** command to start the development server.
```
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app.
