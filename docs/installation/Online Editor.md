# Online Editor

Whenever we are starting our coading it is not always that we have a good system to work on and I believe that because of this learning should not stop. And thanks to the technology now we can do almost everything in the cloud and it is very simple. The best part is since it is in the cloud so we can acess it from almost any browser or device and learn on the go.

## What is an IDE?
Basically, IDE is a piece of software with a wide range of functions that help in the development of other software. IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging.

## What is the difference between IDE and Text Editor?
The short answer to this question is that code/text editors only allow you to write and edit, maybe with some advanced features. On the contrary, IDEs do all the things simple text editors do plus a huge number of more advanced stuff you can’t do with text editors. Above you can see features that usually come with a good IDE. Basically, they equip you with everything you need to turn code into a functioning app or program.

For some people, the true distinction between an IDE and a plain text editor is the ability to compile your code right inside the tool.

A code editor is roughly an advanced text editor for working with code. As a rule, the most important functions of a code editor are syntax highlighting, indicating errors, and working with files – these differ from a regular text editor.
