# React Environment Setup

In this section, we will learn how to set up an environment for the successful development of ReactJS application.

## Pre-requisite for ReactJS
1. NodeJS and NPM
2. React and React DOM
3. Webpack
4. Babel

Well for beginners I don't this we should go much deep into this and we should just stick with the simple process. 

## Get Started Immediately
You don’t need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you’re good to go.

You’ll need to have `Node >= 10` on your local development machine which you can download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects. But for now just download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) from the given website and you will be good to go.
